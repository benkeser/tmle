Changes/Bug Fixes in Version 1.4.0

--  Default settings have changed from the previous versions

    -- New tuning parameters control estimation of g, and choice of targeting procedure
        -- prescreenW.g = TRUE.  Covariates included in the models for the components of g are now pre-screened by default to exclude those not associated with residual bias after the initial estimation of Q.  (Set to FALSE to replicate behavior in older versions).

       -- target.gWt = TRUE. The targeting procedure now incorporates into the weights when fitting epsilon by maximum likelihood, rather than in the denominator of the clever covariates. (Set to FALSE to replicate behavior in older versions.) 

    -- Q.SL.library and g.SL.library are now defined as SL.glm, SL.dbarts, and SL.glmnet, (formerly, SL.glm, SL.step, and SL.glm.interaction).

    -- Qbounds that are not specified by the user are now set to 1% beyond the range of the observed Y (formerly 10%).

    -- cvQinit is now set to TRUE so the initial estimate of Q returns cross-validated predictions by default (formerly FALSE)

    -- alpha is now set to 0.9995 (formerly 0.995).  

  -- automatic = TRUE.  Sets all tuning parameters to their default values, ignoring user-specified values. Also data-adaptively sets V based on sample size ('help tmle' for more details).


Changes/Bug Fixes in Version 1.3.0-2

-- W can now be passed in as a vector, matrix, or dataframe

-- Corrected small bug in variance calculation in tmleMSM function when outcomes are continuous

Changes/Bug Fixes in Version 1.3.0-1

-- Corrected small bug in oneStepATT function where bounds on g were initially ignored

Changes/Bug Fixes in Version 1.3.0

-- tmle function now returns the additive effect of treatment among the treated (ATT) and among the controls (ATC)

Changes/Bug Fixes in Version 1.2.0-5

-- Updated to be compatible with SuperLearner v2.0-21. SL.glm.interaction no longer masked. 

-- Option to specify number of cross-validation folds for SL estimation of Q and g, default remains V = 5.

Changes/Bug Fixes in Version 1.2.0-1

-- FEV dataset included withing the package

-- Update examples for tmleMSM()

Changes/Bug Fixes in Version 1.2.0

-- New tmleMSM() function for estimating parameters of an arbitry MSM. Type help(tmleMSM) for details.

-- Now works with SuperLearner versions 1.0 through 2.0-6

    -- Default SuperLearner libraries for Q and g are now set to (SL.glm, SL.step, SL.glm.interaction), 
        all of which are included in the base installation of R.  

    -- Specifying SuperLearner screening algorithms within calls to SuperLearner is not supported. 

    -- If SuperLearner fails while estimating Q, the program quits instead of defaulting to main terms
       regression with glm.  But, if a call to SuperLearner fails when estimating g, the program prints a
       warning message, and defaults to estimating g with main terms regression.  This way, initial 
       estimate of Q, will be returned, and can be supplied to the next invocation of the function 
       without having to be be re-calculated.

-- Interaction terms now allowed in user-specified formulas for estimating Q and g 

-- Factors are allowed in covariate matrix W, but will only work correctly when glm is used to estimate 
   Q and g. (Super Learner does not support factors. Conversion to dummy variables is recommended)
